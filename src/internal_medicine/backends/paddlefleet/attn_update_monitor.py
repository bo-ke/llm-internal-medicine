"""Attention update monitoring for PaddleFleet.

QK-product increment monitor from "Mechanism-Driven Monitors for Preemptive
Detection of LLM Training Instability" (arXiv:2606.28116) Section 3.4.

With the query/key factors sampled at two steps ``t`` and ``t - delta``, writing
``dWq = Wq_t - Wq_base``, ``dWk = Wk_t - Wk_base`` and evaluating the
un-subscripted factors at the base point ``t - delta``:

    delta1 = Wq_t Wk_t^T - Wq_base Wk_base^T = delta2 + delta3
    delta2 = dWq Wk^T + Wq dWk^T        (first order)
    delta3 = dWq dWk^T                  (second order)

Both monitored terms factorise exactly (eq. 4) — ``delta2 = [dWq, Wq][Wk, dWk]^T``
with factors ``[d, 2*head_dim]``, ``delta3 = dWq dWk^T`` with factors
``[d, head_dim]`` — so when the factor width is below ``d`` their nonzero
singular values are those of the small core ``R_A R_B^T`` built from thin QR
factors and the ``d x d`` product is never materialised.

``delta1`` is deliberately not monitored: eq. (5) gives
``||delta2||_F = O(||W||_F ||dW||_F)`` against ``||delta3||_F = O(||dW||_F^2)``,
so the early-to-mid regime ``||dW||_F << ||W||_F`` makes ``delta1 ~= delta2``,
and re-measuring it would cost another full ``2*head_dim`` core. ``delta3`` is
kept because it is the only term living in Q/K update-*coupling* space. Its core
is half as wide, but that buys less than the ``r^3`` eigensolve scaling suggests:
measured on one H-series GPU at ``hidden=1024, head_dim=128`` over 18 layers,
delta2 alone is 138 ms, delta3 alone 72 ms (0.52x), and both bucketed into one
driver call 211 ms — so adding delta3 costs ~1.5x, not ~1.1x. The thin QRs are
``O(d r^2)`` and dominate the ``O(r^3)`` eigensolve at these shapes.

Per layer and per term this reports the Frobenius norm, the stable rank
``||.||_F^2 / ||.||_2^2`` and the singular-spectrum effective rank
``exp(-sum_i p_i log p_i)`` with ``p_i = sigma_i^alpha / sum_j sigma_j^alpha``
(alpha = 2, the value the paper reports as the sensitivity/noise trade-off).

All three metrics are functions of ``sigma^2`` only, so the spectrum comes from
``eigvalsh`` on the Gram matrix and every layer goes through one batched call.
The decomposition is ~99% of the cost; snapshotting, stacking and the two
matmuls together measure ~10 ms. Same-run comparison at
``d = 2*head_dim = 1024`` over 18 layers, alongside a live training job:
looped ``svd`` 2054 ms, looped Gram+``eigvalsh`` 420 ms, batched
Gram+``eigvalsh`` 277 ms. Absolute numbers move by ~2x with GPU contention, so
treat them as ratios.

The fault certificate is the deviation of these curves from a healthy baseline
run, not low rank on its own: healthy updates already carry low-rank structure
that LoRA/GaLore/Muon exploit. The paper's absolute lead times are measured on
plain MHA and do not transfer: Section 6 notes that for MLA/GQA/MQA the QK
operator is mediated by compression projections and shared heads, so detection
thresholds stay variant-specific even though the algebra below is exact.

``resolve_qk_factors`` recovers the per-head circuit from weights alone for four
layouts — DSv4-hybrid, MLA (content/NoPE half only), a fused ``qkv_proj``, and
independent q/k projections — and skips any layer it cannot read. Adding a
layout means adding one resolver to ``_LAYOUT_RESOLVERS``.

    No forward hooks are needed: the monitor reads query/key weights at step
    boundaries and keeps the previous reading as the base point, so the sampling
    interval ``delta`` is this monitor's own interval — ``sample_interval`` when
    given, otherwise the shared ``monitor_interval``. Sampling independently is
    useful because the cost here is one eigensolve per layer per sample, unlike
