"""DSA (DeepSeek Sparse Attention) metric math for PaddleFleet.

Pure tensor functions so the semantics can be tested without a model. Every
function returns GPU 0-dim tensors; nothing here syncs to host.

All of it is computed on a **subsample of query rows** (see
:func:`sample_query_rows`). The indexer's own scoring is ``O(sq x sk x h x d)``
and the dense attention it is compared against is ``O(sq x sk x H x d)``, so
reproducing either at full sequence length would cost as much as the layer
itself. Rows are drawn from the region where the top-k rule actually selects
something -- below ``index_topk`` valid keys every causal position is selected
and every reading is trivially saturated.
