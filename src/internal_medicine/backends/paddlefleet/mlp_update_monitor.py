"""MoE expert update monitoring for PaddleFleet.

Tracks the parameter increment of the expert MLPs,

    dW[l, e, m] = W[l, e, m]_t - W[l, e, m]_{t - delta},

for layer ``l``, local expert ``e`` and matrix ``m`` in gate / up / down, then
reduces it to per-layer statistics over the experts. This is the MoE counterpart
of ``attn_update``: same "read weights at step boundaries, keep the previous
reading as the base point" scheme, no forward hooks.

The headline metric is the RELATIVE update

    r[l, e, m] = ||dW[l, e, m]||_F / (||W[l, e, m]||_F + eps),

which is comparable across layers and experts in a way ``||dW||_F`` alone is not.
Each matrix also reports the stable rank ``||dW||_F^2 / ||dW||_2^2``, i.e. how
many directions the update actually spans.

Per the diagnostic intent the reduction order matters: every (layer, expert,
matrix) triple is measured on its own and only then summarised per layer, never
by concatenating experts into one matrix. The summaries are mean / median /
p10 / p90 / min / max, which is what separates the four failure modes this is
for -- one expert updating far too much (max), experts that barely move at all
(min, p10), uneven learning speed across experts (p90 - p10), and an update that
narrows onto a few singular directions (stable rank).

``sigma_1 / ||dW||_F`` is deliberately not reported: it equals
``1 / sqrt(stable_rank)`` exactly, so it carries no information the stable rank
does not already carry.

Cost and precision, measured on the 4B-A500M shapes (32 local experts per EP
rank, weight1 ``[32, 512, 1024]``, weight2 ``[32, 512, 512]``), one H800:

* Norms plus a batched power iteration for ``sigma_1``: 11.3 ms/layer, 0.20 s
  over 18 layers. This is the default tier.
* The full Gram + ``eigvalsh`` spectrum needed for the singular entropy:
  500.9 ms/layer, 9.02 s over 18 layers. Off unless ``log_spectrum=True``.

``sigma_1`` comes from a power iteration rather than an eigensolve, and its error
profile happens to favour the thing being detected: convergence goes as
``(sigma_2 / sigma_1)^(2k)``, so at 30 iterations a rank-dominated update
(``sigma_2 / sigma_1 = 0.25``) is exact to 5e-8 while a flat random update
(``0.99``) carries ~1.2% on ``sigma_1`` and ~2.4% on the stable rank. The
imprecise case is the one where the stable rank is large and its exact value does
not change the reading; the precise case is the collapse being monitored. The
error is one-sided -- an underestimated ``sigma_1`` inflates the stable rank.

Two limits worth knowing before reading the curves:

* The base snapshot is a clone in the parameter's own dtype, so for bf16 expert
  weights ``dW`` is exact with respect to what is readable, but it is quantised
  to the bf16 grid: an update below ~2^-9 of the weight magnitude is invisible
  and reads as ``r = 0``. A "sleeping expert" verdict therefore means "not moving
  in the representable weights over ``delta`` steps", which is what a longer
  ``sample_interval`` buys. Reading the optimizer's fp32 master weights instead
  would lift this, at the price of reaching into the optimizer.
* ``_mean``, ``_min`` and ``_max`` reduce correctly across EP ranks (each rank
  holds its own expert shard, and the expert count divides evenly across the
  group). ``_median`` / ``_p10`` / ``_p90`` do not: what lands in the log is the
  mean of the per-rank quantiles, not the global quantile. That is accepted here
  as a spread signal, the same trade the megatron-side spectral entropy makes.

A small update is not by itself a functional verdict: an expert routed few tokens
has little to learn from. Read these against the routed-token distribution that
``moe_health`` already reports (``assignment_load_cv``, ``assignment_load_min_frac``,
``assignment_load_max_min_ratio``, ``gate_mass_*``) rather than duplicating it
here. A true functional drift measure -- expert output displacement on a fixed
probe batch -- needs the old weights kept live and an extra expert forward, so it
is out of scope for a weights-only probe.
