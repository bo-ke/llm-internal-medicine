"""Exact cross-rank norms for grad_health: plan the reduction, then check it.

Backend-agnostic: pure Python, no ``paddle`` / ``torch`` import. Both the
PaddleFleet and Megatron ``grad_health`` monitors build their exact-norm
reduction on top of this planner; the only backend-specific part is how a named
process group is turned into a :class:`GroupInfo` (paddle ``ProcessGroupCollection``
vs. torch ``parallel_state`` + ``get_process_group_ranks``).

History, because it is the reason for every check below: the first version
chained the reductions -- sum over ``cp``, then keep going on the same buffer
over ``dp`` -- which silently assumes the two rank sets are orthogonal. On a
``sharding_first`` topology with ``data_parallel_size=1`` the samples live on the
sharding dimension, so ``_DATA_PARALLEL_GROUP`` spans ``cp`` and the
context-parallel contribution was counted twice: ``norm_global`` came out
``sqrt(cp)`` high (+41% at ``cp=2``) with nothing in the numbers to show it. The
reducer's own log line already contained the contradiction (``cp=2 x dp=32`` on a
32-rank job), it just was not checked. Chaining was only ever correct by luck.
